# No More Tweet

I just felt bored on the endless timeline on social media platforms. And I realise that I just want somewhere to record my life and make it accessible to my close friends. That is why I decide to start this repo. I am trying to use `Issues` to share and organize my spark joys which I previously posted on Twitter. Hope this could be a better way to fulfill my desire of self-expression and get rid of the overwhelming information on social media.
