# No More Tweet

I just felt bored on the endless timeline on social media platforms. And I realise that I just want somewhere to record my life and make it accessible to my close friends. That is why I decide to start this repo. I am trying to use `Code`, `Issues`, and `Wiki` to draft my spark joys which I previously posted on Twitter; and I will re-write them into blogs or essays when these random pieces become better organized. Hope this could be a better way of self-expression while getting rid of the overwhelming information on social media.
